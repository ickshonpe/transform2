# Transform2

2D Transform for Bevy.

Hacked together after hours of annoying struggles with quaternions (and I have a degree in Mathematics, not that anyone could ever tell, I don't know how non-maths heads cope).

Immediately after I wrote this, and felt really clever with my solution, I found bevy_mod_transform2d on
Github and its more or less exactly the same as this library (except where it's better of course).
